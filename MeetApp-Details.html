                     list of events happening there. Built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique.
                     The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

                  <p>
                     The MeetApp project was developed as part of the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development course.
                     The goal of the project was to build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to search for
                     events in a specific city and view a list of upcoming events. The application needed to be
                     responsive, interactive, and accessible, with a focus on user experience and performance. The
                     project brief specified the use of React, TDD, and the Google Calendar API, as well as the
                     implementation of a service worker for offline functionality.

               <h2>Objective</h2>
               <p>
                  The application needed to support the following features:

               <h1>Technology Stack Decisions</h1>
               <p>The Project Brief required the use of React, TDD, and the Google Calendar API, as well as the
                  implementation of a service worker for offline functionality. Based on these requirements, I chose
                  the following technologies for the MeetApp project:
               </p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>React</h3>
                     <p>React is a popular front-end library for building user interfaces. Its component-based
                        architecture, virtual DOM, and one-way data flow make it an ideal choice for creating
                        interactive, responsive web applications. React's declarative syntax, reusable components, and
                        unidirectional data flow simplify the development process and improve code maintainability.
                        By
                        using React in the MeetApp project, I was able to create a fast, efficient web application
                        that
                        provides a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
                     <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development technique that involves writing tests
                        before implementing features. By following a TDD approach, I was able to write tests that
                        defined
                        the expected behavior of the application and then write code to make the tests pass. This
                        iterative process helped me catch bugs early, improve code quality, and ensure that the
                        application met the project requirements. TDD also encouraged me to write modular, testable
                        code
                        that was easy to maintain and extend, resulting in a more robust, reliable application.</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Google Calendar API</h3>
                     <p>The Google Calendar API is a powerful tool for accessing and managing calendar data. By
                        integrating the Google Calendar API into the MeetApp project, I was able to fetch upcoming
                        events
                        based on the user's search criteria and display them in the application. The API provided
                        access
                        to event details such as name, date, time, location, and description, as well as links to the
                        event page and a map showing the event location. By leveraging the Google Calendar API, I was
                        able
                        to provide users with up-to-date information about events happening in their city and create
                        a
                        dynamic, engaging user experience.</p>

                     <h3>AWS Lambda</h3>
                     <p>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning
                        or managing servers. By using AWS Lambda in the MeetApp project, I was able to execute
                        server-side
                        logic in response to events triggered by the application. Lambda functions provided a
                        scalable,
                        cost-effective way to handle tasks such as fetching data from the Google Calendar API,
                        processing
                        user input, and sending notifications to users. By leveraging AWS Lambda, I was able to build
                        a
                        flexible, efficient back-end architecture that supported the application's functionality and
                        performance requirements.</p>

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the MeetApp project was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to
                  demonstrate my skills in front-end development, test-driven development, and API integration. By
                  using React, TDD, and the Google Calendar API, I was able to build a Progressive Web App that
                  provides users with up-to-date information about events happening in their city. The application
                  features a responsive, interactive design, fast performance, and offline functionality, making it
                  easy to use and accessible on a variety of devices. The project also gave me the opportunity to
                  practice writing clean, modular code, creating reusable components, and following best practices
                  for web development. Overall, the MeetApp project was a valuable learning experience that
                  strengthened my front-end development skills and prepared me for future projects in the field.</p>
