                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                     The ChatApp is a native mobile chat application, built using React Native, Expo, and Google
                     Firestore.
                     It features a streamlined chat interface that allows users to easily share messages, images, and
                     location
                     data with friends and family. Asynchronous offline storage keeps the app usable while offline, and
                     a
                     real-time Firebase/Firestore database on the server side makes for lightning fast and consistent
                     functionality
                     while online.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                  <p>More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists,
                     communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. This app was developed as a portfolio
                     project
                     for
                     the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Web Development course, demonstrating proficiency in building mobile
                     applications
                     using React Native, Firebase, Expo, and related technologies. With mobile chat apps among the most
                     popular
                     in
                     the world, creating a fully functional chat app with React Native is an indispensable skill.</p>

               <h1>Technology Stack Decisions</h1>
               <p>Careful scrutiny of the Project Brief led me to some key decisions about technologies to use
                  for this application. The Project Brief also included specifics on the UI and provided some
                  assets which we were required to utilize. Here is my rationale for the technologies chosen:

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>React Native</h3>
                     <p>React Native allows for building cross-platform mobile apps using a single codebase. This
                        significantly reduces development time and complexity while providing a native look and feel
                        for both iOS and Android users. The framework also supports third-party libraries and native
                        components,
                        ensuring optimal performance.</p>
                     <h3>Gifted Chat Library</h3>
                     <p>React Native's Gifted Chat library provides a highly customizable chat UI out-of-the-box,
                        significantly accelerating
                        the development process. It supports message bubbles, avatars, media attachments, and various
                        other features, reducing the need for reinventing the wheel.</p>

                     <h3>Firebase Anonymous Authentication</h3>
                     <p>Firebase Anonymous Authentication enables user identification without requiring explicit
                        sign-ups or email verification. This simplifies the onboarding process, allowing users to
                        immediately access chat rooms while maintaining a layer of user differentiation and security.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Firestore Database</h3>
                     <p>Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database, is ideal for real-time applications. It supports seamless
                        synchronization across devices, offline data access, and secure data storage for chat
                        messages and images. Its integration with Firebase Authentication ensures data integrity and
                        user-specific
                        access.

                     Using the Project Brief as a guide, I set up my Chat App project with React Native via Expo,
                     created
                     its layout, and styled it.

                     implemented a form so the user could enter their name, background color customization, and a "start

                     and iOS. <br><br>The project was then committed to GitHub and recorded for documentation purposes.

                     rendered, a GiftedChat component in Chat.js. I managed the messages state with useState() and added

                     <br><br>After
                     installing
                     firebase, I initialized Firebase and Firestore in App.js, passing the database object to the
                     chat
                     component.
                     In Start.js, I implemented anonymous user login with signInAnonymously(), passing the user ID,
                     name,
                     and
                     background color to the chat screen upon successful login. <br><br>In Chat.js, I used the Firestore
                     onSnapshot()
                     listener to fetch messages in real-time, ensuring messages were sorted by createdAt in descending
                     order.
                     I updated the onSend() function to save new messages directly to Firestore using addDoc().

                  </div>
                  <div>Again, I pushed everything to GitHub, then tested and recorded the app's behavior for
                     documentation.
                  </div>
               </div>

               <div class="descr">
                  <div>
                     The next step in the process was implementing a real-time network connectivity detection system and
                     managing offline message storage. Using useNetInfo() to monitor network status, I wrote functions
                     to
                     toggle network status and passed that information in a prop to Chat.js, allowing the chat screen to
                     adapt its data source
                     based on connectivity.
                     <br><br>In Chat.js, messages were fetched from Firestore if the connection was present, and local
                     storage if not. Additionally, the input toolbar was disabled in offline mode to prevent users from
                     composing messages or sending images.

                     <br><br>Testing the app in both online and offline modes was crucial to ensure seamless
                     functionality.
                     Expo and Android Studio, as well a several handheld devices, were used in this phase to ensure
                     functionality. <br><br>Finally, I documented the
                     project, updated the GitHub repository, and recorded a demonstration showcasing the app's behavior
                     in
                     offline mode. The recording illustrated message retrieval from AsyncStorage and the absence of the
                     input toolbar, effectively demonstrating the implemented offline functionality. Android Studio was
                     used
                     in part to test functionality, and also to record tests for documentation.

                     location.
                     By connecting the app to Firebase Storage, images and location data could be securely uploaded and
                     retrieved.
                     <br><br>I created the custom action sheet through a new CustomActions.js component, integrated with
                     GiftedChat
                     to
                     handle image picking, camera usage, and geolocation sharing. I also customized the chat's message
                     bubbles
                     to display maps for location messages.

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the ChatApp presented a range of challenges and valuable learning experiences. One of the
                  most
                  significant challenges was implementing seamless real-time messaging and offline functionality using
                  Firebase
                  Firestore. Coordinating Firestore synchronization with AsyncStorage to maintain a consistent chat
                  experience
                  required careful management of the network status and message caching mechanisms.</p>
               <p>Another challenge was incorporating various media-sharing features, particularly managing permissions
                  for
                  accessing the device's camera, image library, and location services. Ensuring a smooth user experience
                  involved
                  not only adhering to React Native's permissions requirements but also carefully structuring custom
                  action
                  sheets to deliver a polished user interface.</p>
               <p>Despite these challenges, the project was a valuable learning journey. I learned how to effectively
                  use
                  React-Native as a platform, Firebase and Firestore as backend services, and GiftedChat as a
                  third-party
                  library. I also gained insights into implementing advanced features for media sharing, enhancing
                  accessibility
                  through throughtful UI design, and modularizing components for reusability.</p>
               Firebase and Firestore, utilize anonymous authorization of users, enhance accessibility features, and
               implement
               modular, reusable components.
               Utilizing GiftedChat provided insight into integrating third-party libraries and customizing them to fit
               specific requirements.</p>
               <p>If I were to approach this project again, I would:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Implement More Advanced Features</strong>: Always wanting to
                     push the envelope, I am always thinking of new features to implement, such as Chat Channels,
                     Contact Lists, and Push Notifications to expand usability. However, it is also important to keep
                     focus on present tasks and not get sidetracked.</li>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Modularize Features More Extensively</strong>: Breaking down
                     features like media-sharing
                     and
                     geolocation into smaller, more focused components would have streamlined development and improved
                     code
                     readability.</li>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Expand Testing Strategy</strong>: Incorporate automated tests
                     for critical features like
                     message
                     sending, media sharing, and offline behavior to catch bugs earlier and ensure consistent
                     functionality.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Overall, the ChatApp project showcased the power of React Native for cross-platform mobile development
                  and
                  solidified my understanding of Firebase's comprehensive backend services. Moving forward, I'll carry
                  these
                  lessons into future projects, refining my development workflow and continuing to build intuitive,
                  user-friendly
                  applications.</p>
